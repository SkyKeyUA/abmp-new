							[music] 0:00:42.9 S1: Anatomy Trains is thrilled to announce our first ever Women's Health

							work. Visit
							anatomytrains.com for details. [music] 0:01:29.1 Allison Denney: Hi, my name is Allison Denney and
							this is The Rebel
							MT podcast, where you'll hear me forcibly colliding the worlds of anatomical jargon and humor. I
							believe that when
							you know your anatomy, the what, and you know your physiology, the how, the techniques will follow.
							But the loads of
							Latin and the gobs of Greek can make a cranium convulse. It is a little overwhelming to dip your
							toe into the sea of
							anatomical knowledge, only to find that it is a bottomless ocean. You are smart, but this is
							intimidating. You will
							get there eventually. In the meantime, let's look at things differently so that you will actually
							want to take a swim
							or at least hop on a boat and take a peak at what's under the surface. [music] 0:02:15.3 AD: I had
							a client once who
							called and demanded a promise that I would fix her if she came in to see me, a relative newbie in
							the field at the
							time with an over-inflated sense of confidence, I promised. I said, "I got you, I have a couple of
							tricks up my
							sleeve." What? Needless to say, I became immediately bogged down with a grip of emotions spanning
							from a deep desire
							to rise to the occasion and an inflated ego telling me that I actually could, to total confusion
							about how I would
							manage this, and then of course, the humiliation in realizing that they experienced a momentary
							lapse of reason.
							Fixing someone is not a thing. Everyone seems to want to be fixed. But it is, in reality, just not
							a thing. And there
							are many layers to this. A heap of philosophers will debate for days, weeks, months and years
							around this topic. But
							for today, I'm going to explore two of the main layers that are integral to the work we do as
							massage therapists.
							0:03:21.6 AD: First, there is the client and their perception of fixing pain and then there is us
							and our desire to
							do the fixing. The very curious and complicated subject of pain and suffering is one that circles
							the work we do
							constantly. How do we get a client to express what they feel? How do we know what they think is
							normal? And how do we
							know if we are doing the right work, the work they need in that moment? We don't, really. There are
							lots of great
							indicators to help us determine if our work is productive or not, but there are also a lot of
							factors that we have no
							control over. Whether or not a client is doing the necessary steps to help themselves when they are
							not in our office
							is out of our hands. Whether or not the work we do will last an hour or a day or a week is
							difficult to predict. And
							whether or not a client is just really nice and thanks us for the amazing job we just did because
							they want us to
							feel good for working so hard that they complement our work, even though they wince and find
							bruises once they get
							home, might be the actual reality. 0:04:30.1 AD: So pain, and a client's perception of pain, is a
							lot more convoluted
							than a chart that indicates which face emoji they most relate to in that moment. A client, like the
							one I mentioned
							in the beginning who demanded to be fixed, has a set notion of expectations and the lens through
							which they
							experienced life that dictates how our interaction with them lands. Then there is our perception.
							Most of us got into
							this field out of a desire to help others, we know people experience pain and we want to help. But
							even that simple
							momentum is convoluted, it is noble indeed to want to help, but helping others often appeases a
							deeper desire to be
							the hero, so to speak, and this complicates things. To be the person who comes to the rescue is
							something that feeds
							our ego on some deep level, whether we like to admit it or not. 0:05:29.3 AD: Just like our client
							who is doing who
							knows what when we are not directly influencing their issue or dysfunction, we are equally as
							bogged down with
							cognitive and emotional lenses that shift how or why we do what we do. Many of us grow attached to
							the outcome, many
							of us feel some version of pain or suffering when we are not fixing our clients, and many of us
							have a difficult time
							separating our true purpose from these sticky layers of perception. Psychologists, neurologists,
							Buddhists, and many,
							many others have written timelessly about the intrinsic relationship between suffering and
							happiness. Without going
							too far down that road, I want to explore the actual techniques of what to do when a person is in
							pain or suffering
							and how to navigate all the lenses of our interactions. The Levator Scapula is the perfect muscle
							for this topic. It
							is one that causes both clients and body workers a frustrating amount of irritation. It commonly
							holds a chronic
							contraction, it cramps up and sends referring pain throughout the head and neck, and it doesn't
							seem to want to let
							go. 0:06:42.2 AD: The client is upset because they feel the grip this muscle has and they want to
							sometimes literally
							rip it out of their necks, and the massage therapist is frustrated because it does not appear to
							respond very well to
							the work. All the trigger point therapy, pin and stretches and positional releases in the world
							only scratch the
							surface. That damn muscle invariably fires back and make everyone mad, it seems to have a mind of
							its own. Let's look
							at the details. A skeletal muscle is made of muscle fibers. We sometimes even call a skeletal
							muscle striated because
							of what the fibers look like under a microscope. Looking even deeper, each of those fires has
							little tiny
							micro-filaments inside of them called actin and myosin that want to grab on to each other and hug
							each other really
							tightly. When they do, they squeeze so tight that they actually pull the ends of the muscle closer
							together, and the
							ends, being attached to two different bones, start to move. Hence, the bones themselves shift
							positions and voila! We
							have joint movement. Human Anatomy really is a spectacular thing. 0:07:52.7 AD: Anyway, for the
							Levator Scapula, the
							bones this muscle brings closer together are the neck bone and the shoulder bone, more
							specifically, the first
							through fourth transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and the medial border of the scapula,
							between the
							superior angle and the spine and the scapula. So yeah, the neck bone and the shoulder bone. So when
							those little
							actin and myosin filaments start hugging, the shoulder starts to move closer to the neck and the
							neck starts to move
							closer to the shoulder. Mostly the former, but it's never really just one or the other. In broader
							terms, though, the
							Levator Scapula wants to shrug the shoulder up to the ears, it's what it was born to do. It also
							wants, very badly,
							thank you very much, to pull the ear to the shoulder. It's purpose in life, so to speak, is to help
							you keep your
							phone in place, so you can talk to your friends while cooking dinner, and you don't have the time
							to find your
							earbuds. It's got a serious job, and it takes that job very seriously. The problem is this, the
							Levator Scapula is so
							good at what it does that it does it way more than we really need it to. Kind of like when a kid
							learns a new task,
							like tying his shoe, and now all of a sudden everyone needs their shoes tied and he's gonna be the
							one doing it.
							0:09:06.6 AD: Not really the most efficient activity, but that kid is a shoe tying machine, there
							is no stopping him.
							And there is, in a sense, no stopping the Levator Scapula either. Which brings me to my bottom
							line, how do we stop
							something which can't be stopped? We don't, we just choose a different lens of perception. Remember
							how we really
							wanna fix things? Maybe that's not the end goal. Maybe the end goal is to find new methods of
							management. If the
							client is frustrated because this muscle is creating chronic pain issues, and you're frustrated
							because your client
							doesn't seem to be listening to when you're telling him or her to let go, hanging out in your
							frustration is not
							productive for either one of you. Trying to fix that which can't be fixed is not a path lined with
							flowers and
							rainbows, it is solid concrete and not very fun. 0:10:03.1 AD: Fixing a Levator Scapula is a lot
							like fixing anger.
							We are born with this ability, and it serves a purpose. Anger, as angering as it may be, helps us
							to defend that
							which needs defending. Anger rises to the occasion when a muffled voice needs to speak or a cog in
							the chain is
							broken and is preventing us from moving forward. But anger, much like the fibers of the Levator
							Scapula, isn't aware
							that it can be problematic, so getting angry at anger is futile. Try this, next time you've got a
							client in your
							office with a rogue Levator Scapula, start by honoring it for doing exactly what it's supposed to
							do. However you
							wanna do this is up to you. Silently, in your own head, speaking directly to it and risking the
							chance that your
							client thinks you've lost your marbles or a candle lit seance with your client and all of his or
							her loved ones
							holding hands in a circle, it doesn't matter how you do it. What's important is that you shift your
							perspective.
							0:11:06.6 AD: Once you've pivoted, your work becomes more about moving with this muscle as opposed
							to against it.
							Find the position it feels most at ease in and go from there, if the shoulder is being hiked up to
							an ear, try
							holding that Levator Scapula with one hand and using your other hand to hike that shoulder up even
							higher and then
							see how it reacts. Maybe it goes into spasm because it didn't really think you were gonna do that
							and you just called
							its bluff. Maybe it locks up even more and stubbornly refuses to show any signs of weakness, or
							maybe it actually
							starts to soften because, dang, if that muscle isn't exhausted. The point is, not every Levator
							Scapula is going to
							act the same from client to client and how you handle yourself in each session is going to be
							equally as different.
							0:11:56.6 AD: Remember that the complicated layers to what defines pain is going to present
							uniquely with each
							client. Remember also that your role here is not necessarily one of the hero, it is one of
							observing. Watch how this
							muscle responds, listen to what your client is telling you and feel for what technique might be
							appropriate for right
							now. You don't need to be the fixer. Your client want space to just be, more than anything else.
							And this powerhouse
							of a neck muscle just wants to do what it's supposed to do, you can't blame it for that. This new
							mindset might even
							be the thing that breaks the code. You and your client might actually be able to hop off that
							chronic pain and
							frustration cycle and start something new. 0:12:48.3 AD: And here we are, the end of the episode.
