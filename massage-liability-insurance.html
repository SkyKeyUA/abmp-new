					<h1>Massage Therapist Liability Insurance</h1>
					<p>Whether you've built a thriving massage practice over many years or are just starting out in the
						profession, it's
						important to consider how to protect yourself in case something goes wrong during a session and a
						client sues you.
						Liability insurance for massage therapists and bodyworkers is one of the core benefits of an ABMP
						membership, and you
						can be confident that the coverage you get is designed to protect you.</p>
					<div class="pocketsuite__info-line info-line">
						<div class="info-line__image info-line__image--contain">
							<img src="img/icons/heartHands.svg" alt="Heart Hands Icon">
						</div>
						<div class="info-line__text">
							<p>"I recently switched from AMTA and <strong>WOW! Love ABMP.</strong> Not a thing I thought I
								would ever say about my insurance or professional organization." -Nicole</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h2>Why Massage Therapists and Bodyworkers Need Insurance</h2>
					<p>No practitioner ever intends to hurt a client, but it happens. From falling off a massage chair, to
						tripping on rugs,
						to suffering bruising or broken ribs when a practitioner applies massage too deeply, clients can come
						away from your
						sessions injured.</p>
					<p>That is why professional massage liability insurance is the safety net every massage therapist and
						bodyworker needs
						to protect themselves. The peace of mind that comes with this protection is priceless; it allows you
						to focus on your
						craft and not the unexpected.</p>
					<p><a href="/updates/benefits/massage-liability-insurance-your-safety-net">Learn How to Minimize Your
							Risk</a></p>
					<h2>How Massage Therapy Insurance with ABMP Protects You</h2>
					<p>ABMP offers liability coverage with the profession's highest limits available: $2 million per
						occurrence, $6 million
						annual aggregate. And these coverages protect you no matter where, or how many places you work. These
						totals are per
						member, per year. There is no shared master policy aggregate like AMTA. You never have to fear that
						other members
						will use up your limit. While that may be an unlikely scenario, ABMP works with our insurance partner
						to try to
						eliminate those kinds of risks-you can learn more about individual limits in this <a class="d-inline"
							href="/updates/blog-posts/expect-more-les-why-abmp-liability-insurance-does-not-have-shared-aggregate">explanation
							from ABMP President Les Sweeney</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Bottom line: ABMP's liability insurance package is a comprehensive program specifically
							tailored for massage
							therapists and bodyworkers.</strong></p>
					<p>ABMP's greatest strength is helping our members. One of the most important things you get with ABMP
						membership is not
						about the actual insurance policy-in the event of an incident you call ABMP first, not the insurance
						company like
						other associations, and our team will walk you through your next steps. We never leave you to face a
						stressful
						situation alone. Knowing your ABMP team is ready and able to support you lets you focus on what's most
						important-building a successful career.</p>
					<h2>What Coverage Is Included in the Insurance Policy?</h2>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>Premises Liability</h3>
						<p>The insurance that comes with membership covers other potential risks a massage therapist or
							bodyworker may
							encounter. These risks include premises liability (or slip and fall), personal and advertising
							injury, medical
							expense coverage, and fire legal liability.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>Products Liability</h3>
						<p>Coverage for both external massage products used during the service and those sold by our members
							are included in
							the policy that comes with membership.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>Legal Defense Coverage</h3>
						<p>Legal defense is covered in addition to the policy limits. That is, legal expenses aren't included
							in the policy
							limits like some other associations' policies. This is important, as legal defense costs can often
							be higher than
							the actual amount of a settlement.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>No Upcharge for Additional Insured Endorsements</h3>
						<p>There is no extra charge for obtaining an additional insured endorsement, which is a frequent
							request from massage
							employers or landlords, and something many members add for their legal business name.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>Occurrence-Type Coverage</h3>
						<p>The insurance included with your ABMP membership is occurrence-type coverage, which protects you
							from late-filed
							claims. This added feature helps safeguard your business-and your peace of mind.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-12 students-row">
						<h3>Hot Stone Massage and Cupping</h3>
						<p>ABMP has procured coverage for hot stone massage and vacuum cupping-two modalities that are not
							always covered
							through other associations.</p>
